# Background

This project will be composed of a timed mini-game and a trivia. It will begin with a
mini-game that the user will play and score as high as they can before the time runs out. 
The result will be scored on a points system that will be correlated to the 
total number of points they have. They then will be directed to the trivia and each question answered correctly will add on to their points. Each question answered incorrectly will decrease 
their points. If the user's points hit 0 they lose. Once the user reaches 10000 points,
they win.

# Functionality & MVPs

In this project, users will:

Select the start button to start the game.

Timer will start and they will begin selecting the correct answers for the mini-game. The more they guess correctly, the higher their appeared score will be.

# Technologies, Libraries, API's

D3.js

    Progress Bar
    Timer API
    Transitions API

# Implementation Timeline

NB:

Friday Afternoon & Weekend: 
    Setup project, parse data from Json, create basic layout of game logic/initial conditionals

Monday: Initiate JS coding, record User's answers, document User's points, implement Timer API that correlates with start of game

Tuesday: Link Score with both the Game and the Trivia and implement Transitions API

Wednesday: Fill in gaps, UI emphasis, (strive to make as User-Friendly as possible).

Thursday Morning: Deploy to GitHub pages. If time, rewrite this proposal as a production README.

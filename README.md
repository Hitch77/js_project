# Background

This project will be composed of a timed mini-game and a trivia. It will begin with a
mini-game that the user will play and score as high as they can before the time runs out. 
The result will be scored on a points system that will be correlated to the 
total number of points they have. They then will be directed to the trivia and each question answered correctly will add on to their points. Each question answered incorrectly will decrease 
their points. If the user's points hit 0 they lose. Once the user reaches 10000 points,
they win. At every 1000 point checkpoint, the user will be allowed to play the game again 
for a shot at more points

Example: The User will select a trivia topic, (i.e movies, actors, athletes, geography etc.)
and then will play one of the mini-games that will be executed randomly. The goal 
is to try to score as high as they can. The most points a user can get from the mini game
will be 500 points. 

# Background

This project will provide the user with easy access to quizzes from each topic and subtopics from a full stack curriculum. This will help the user retain their knowledge as they progress through the curriculum so they can strengthen and maintain their foundation of the material. Each subtopic will have its own quiz
and each topic will be a cumulative quiz of all subtopics within.


# Functionality & MVPs

In this project, users will be able to:

{ Access each topic (i.e Ruby, SQL, Rails, JavaScript) and subtopics within (Recursion, Active Record, User Auth, Dom Manipulation)}
{ Be provided with questions that'll tackle core understandings of each topic }
{ Will score the User on the completed quiz and provide descriptions on right and wrong answers }
{ Will show User's progress on main page }

# Wireframes


# Technologies, Libraries, API's

D3.js
    Progress Bar
    Timer API
    Transitions API

# Implementation Timeline

NB:

Friday Afternoon & Weekend: 
    Setup project, choose appropriate and applicable questions, store questions in database preferably by using a database generator, include images of code snippets if necessary.

Monday: Initiate JS coding, record User's progress, document User statistics, implement Timer API that correlates with start of quiz

Tuesday: Link Progress Bar with already documented User progress, and implement Transitions API

Wednesday: Fill in gaps, UI emphasis, (strive to make as User-Friendly as possible).

Thursday Morning: Deploy to GitHub pages. If time, rewrite this proposal as a production README.
